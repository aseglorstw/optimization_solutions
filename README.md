### PCA: Motion Capture Solution

In this solution, I'll be using PCA (Principal Component Analysis) to fit points in space with a linear or affine subspace and minimize the error. 

#### Objective:
The main focus will be on approximating motion capture data with lower-dimensional affine subspaces. This involves finding the principal components of the data and representing them with a linear or affine subspace using PCA. 

#### Methodology:
The goal is to reduce data volume while retaining the essential characteristics of the motion. I'll implement functions to fit the data to subspace representations, visualize the results, and analyze the compression error across different dimensions of the subspace.
